You can find the dataset from [here](https://forms.gle/UVcXFLmEPWqBhR7E6), which contains 4 json files.

Each case file contains two keys:
```
decision_sentence: Index of the sentence where the decision of the judgment indicates. 
decision: 0 represents no direct sentence, phrase, or keywords by which we can infer the judgment resultsâ€”otherwise 1. 
```
