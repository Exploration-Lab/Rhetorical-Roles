You can find the dataset from [here](https://iitk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ashutoshm_iitk_ac_in/EsFgasd9BFVCql13LJ6oPE4BteWn2yxtnYm8g68d3e2PeA?e=GSANqB), which contains 3 JSON files (train-g, dev-g, and test-g).

The dataset is the same as was published in the paper titled "Identification of Rhetorical Roles of Sentences in Indian Legal Judgments," presented at the [International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems (JURIX) 2019](https://jurix2019.oeg-upm.net/index.html). Also available in GitHub repo [Semantic Segmentation of Indian Supreme Court Case Documents](https://github.com/Law-AI/semantic-segmentation).

The dataset contains a total of 50 court case documents judged in the Supreme Court of India, where each sentence has been annotated with its rhetorical role by law students. We split the dataset into train (40 files), dev (5 files), and test (5 files). To reproduce the results, we used the same test dataset.
