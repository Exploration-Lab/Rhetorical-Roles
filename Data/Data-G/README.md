The dataset is the same as was published in the paper titled "Identification of Rhetorical Roles of Sentences in Indian Legal Judgments," presented at the [International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems (JURIX) 2019](https://jurix2019.oeg-upm.net/index.html). Also available in GitHub repo [Semantic Segmentation of Indian Supreme Court Case Documents](https://github.com/Law-AI/semantic-segmentation).

The dataset contains a total of 50 court case documents judged in the Supreme Court of India, where each sentence has been annotated with its rhetorical role by law students. We split the dataset into train (40 files), dev (5 files), and test (5 files) ourselves since the splits are not provided in the original repository. To reproduce our results, consider the same split of the dataset used by us.
